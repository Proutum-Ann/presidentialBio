                <h1>Term 1 (1993-1997)</h1>
                <h2>Election of 1992</h2>
                <p>The election of 1992 wasn't even close. Clinton won by a landslide against his opponent, former President Bush. While the voter turnout wasn't particularly high, it was still more than half the population on average</p>
                <!-- During Term -->
                <h2>What He's Done</h2>
                <p>During his first term of presidency, Bill Clinton worked to progress the American economic landscape, hoping to bring economic ease to his fellow citizens. And he prevailed despite his muddy popularity early in his presidency.</p>
                <p>In just his first term, Clinton had:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Issued an executive order undoing abortion restrictions</li>
                    <li>(Planned) the reduction of national debt</li>
                    <li>Signed the North American Free Trade Agreement which created a trilateral trade bloc in North America</li>
                    <li>Addressed the struggles of low income families</li>
                    <li>Addressed reorganization and reduction in White House staff</li>
                    <li>Addressed security issues within and outside the US that could be detrimental to American safety</li>
                    <li>Allowed unemployment to drop greatly</li>
                    <li>Brought economic rise to the US</li>
                    <li>And quite a bit more</li>
                  </ol>

                <h1>Term 2 (1997-2001)</h1>
                <h2>Election of 1996</h2>
                <p>Clinton was able to do much better in the 1996 election, however, the voter turnout was less than half the eligible voters.</p>
                <!-- During Term -->
                <h2>What He's Done</h2>
                <p>President Clinton continued to work towards progressing the United States towards a more free and diverse future. Education standards, incomes, and home ownership all rose during his presidencies, and crime rates and poverty were an all-time low in over 20 years. He was also noted to have the most diverse cabinet in history.</p>
                <p>He was also able to reduce the national deficit, and put the United States on a path to debt recovery (which, of course, would come crashing down).</p>
